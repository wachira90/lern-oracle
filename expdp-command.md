To export the schema and all tables of a database named "rentcar" in an Oracle database, you can use the Data Pump Export utility. Follow these steps:

1. Open a SQL*Plus or SQLcl session with a user who has the necessary privileges to export the schema and tables (e.g., SYSTEM or a user with the EXP_FULL_DATABASE role).

2. Run the following command to export the entire schema, including all tables, constraints, indexes, and other database objects:

```sql
expdp system/password@//hostname:port/service_name SCHEMAS=rentcar DUMPFILE=rentcar_schema.dmp LOGFILE=rentcar_schema_export.log
```

Replace the following values:

- `system/password`: Your Oracle user with the necessary privileges and its password.
- `hostname`: The hostname or IP address of the Oracle database server.
- `port`: The port number on which the Oracle database is listening (usually 1521).
- `service_name`: The service name of the Oracle database instance.
- `rentcar`: The name of the schema you want to export.
- `rentcar_schema.dmp`: The name and location of the dump file that will be created (you can choose a different name and path if desired).
- `rentcar_schema_export.log`: The name and location of the log file that will be created (you can choose a different name and path if desired).

3. Press Enter to execute the command. The export process will start, and you will see the progress in the SQL*Plus or SQLcl window.

4. Once the export is complete, you will have a dump file (`rentcar_schema.dmp`) containing the schema and all tables, along with a log file (`rentcar_schema_export.log`) with details about the export process.

You can then use the Data Pump Import utility (`impdp`) to import the schema and tables into another Oracle database instance if needed.

Note: Make sure to have enough space available in the destination directory for the dump file, as it may be a large file depending on the size of your database.
